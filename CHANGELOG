CHANGELOG:

v 3.0: 2019- xxx

* Added a stop code to the code
    * Stop code can be used to highlight icing caused stops if there is a separate status code in scada for that.
* Fixed datatype issues with newr versions of numpy
* Added IPS handling capability to loss counter
* Added Power curve uncertainty to power curves:
    * uncertainty defined as std_dev/mean
* Added Status code based stops as a separate case for output
    * Allows counting production losses during a certain status code
* Added IPS and status code stops to summary file
* Added power curve uncertainty to summary file and printed power curve
* Time Based Availability and Energy Based Availability
* Icing losses now counted against actual production instead of theoretical reference



v 2.0: 2017-04-04

* Changed power curve from mean to P50
* fixed bug in air density correction
* fixed bug in production statistics
* separated the temperature level filters
    * different filter levels for building the reference dataset and ice detection
* reformatted the summary summary
* added an example input file that works
* included example case results in the release package

v. 1.1: 2015-11-27 11:25 

* fixed a crash with zero output
* Added new filtering options
    * adjustable power level filter
    * adjustable temperature level filter
    * custom start and stop times
* fixed issues with time stamp indexing
    * no longer assumes timestamps to be at column 0

v. 1.0

Initial public release
