IEA Wind
The International Energy Agency Implementing Agreement for Co-operation in the Research, Development and Deployment of Wind Energy Systems (IEA Wind) is a vehicle for member countries to exchange information on the planning and execution of national, large-scale wind system projects and to undertake co-operative research and development projects called Tasks or Annexes. IEA Wind is part of IEAâ€™s Technology Collaboration Programme or TCP.

The IEA Wind agreement, also known as the Implementing Agreement for Co-operation in the Research, Development, and Deployment of Wind Energy Systems, functions within a framework created by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Views, findings, and publications of IEA Wind do not necessarily represent the views or policies of the IEA Secretariat or of all its individual member countries.

Task 19
For the wind industry, cold climate refers to sites that may experience significant periods of icing events, temperatures below the operational limits of standard wind turbines, or both. There is vast potential for producing electricity at these often windy and uninhabited cold climate sites. Consequently, the International Energy Agency Wind Agreement has since 2002, operated the international working group Task 19 Wind Energy in Cold Climates. The goal of this cooperation is to gather and disseminate information about wind energy in cold climates and to establish guidelines and state-of-the-art information.
